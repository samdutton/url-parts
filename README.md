# Address form best practices

Best practices for address form elements and element attributes.


This example uses a single **Address** textarea with `autocomplete="street-address"`. 

[address-line.glitch.me](https://address-line.glitch.me) is the same, but with 
**Address line 1** and **Address line 2** inputs.
